Especially for support it is often usefull to have an overview about different logs in a special timeframe. 

SAP is using a so called "HANA Full System Info Dump" (see SAP Note 2573880 - FAQ: SAP HANA Full System Info Dump) for collecting data when something goes wrong and they need to analyse customer systems. Such a dump provides also all the trace file from a special timeframe. The idea is to use **GrafHista** for analysing these traces as well. 

To gain first experiences in capturing offline traces and logs I've created three  Docker container. One is a normal Grafana container, one is a mysql container and the last one contains promtail, loki and logcli.

**Important:** At the moment **GrafHista** is a **Beta** version and only a few files can be used for analyzing. 


#### Why is this project named GrafHista:
In the very beginning of the idea to collect offline data, I've put all the code into the [GrafHana](https://gitlab.suse.de/tschloss/grafhana/) project as additional feature. Using additional different container and the fact that it can not only capturing HANA specific data I deside to move it to a separate project.

Therefore a new namen was needed. The name contains the words **Grafana**, **History** and **analyze**.


## How to use:

The following command will deploy and start **GrafHista**:

**docker-compose up -d**

The idea is to point the unpacked fullsysteminfodump and/or the supportconfig to a symlink.

```

#### SAR Files

In case of sar files, the python script **create_sar_db.py** will be triggert on every change and will collect all sar binary files and put it into a DB.

There is already a first Grafana Dashboard named **Sar** where each of the created databases (sar files)  can be selected.

It can be reached out under http://localhost:3000

#### SAP Trace Files (plus system logs)

The promtail configuration will capture the following trace files:

* /logs/fu/HDB*/*/trace/system_availability_*.trc
* /logs/fu/HDB*/*/trace/nameserver*.trc
* /logs/sc/messages.txt

There are also logs from the python script available for debuging porpose only:
/var/log/sar_db.log

Currently there is no dashboard for the trace files available. But it is possible to use the Grafana function Explore to reach it out.

The following Labels are available so far:
